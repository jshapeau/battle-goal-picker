    This app is intended to streamline online play, or for groups that wish to minimize the usage of physical components to reduce set-up and tear-down time.  See [Installation](#Installation) for instructions on installing as a standalone application or for offline use.
    
## Usage
    Choose an Party Name and Number of Draws for your party.  Choose an Expansion - IE, the deck from which battle goals will be drawn.  These settings need to be the same for everyone in your party.

    Choose a unique Player Number for each player, in ascending order, starting at 1.

    Your settings will save between sessions. Before each scenario, you will only need to set the Scenario Number and Attempt Number to get a unique draw for each part member for each scenario.
